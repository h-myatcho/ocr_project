# Nanonet API Practice Repository

This repository is intended for practicing the utilization of the Nanonet API, specifically focusing on customizing a segment of handwritten tables from PDFs/images and exporting them into Excel.


## Frontend Template

For the frontend, I integrated components from the [Medicio Free Bootstrap Theme](https://bootstrapmade.com/medicio-free-bootstrap-theme/).


## Testing Instructions

To test the functionality of this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Update the "url" and "auth" parameters in the `app.py` file:
   - For the "url", visit your Nanonets home, navigate to "My Models > Types > Integrate," and copy the URL from the code.
   - For the "auth", go to your Nanonets home, then access "Account Info > API Keys".
3. After updating the 'url' and 'auth' parameters, proceed to test the integration. You can run the code by opening the terminal and entering 'python app.py.' This will provide a local link for testing purposes. For a global link, you can use Ngrok, but please note that the Ngrok link has a limited availability period.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or have questions about the process.
